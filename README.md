# Complete-Your-Saree-Look-With-These-Festive-Blouses
Due to ethnic and geographical diversity, India has a broad range of stitched and unstitched apparel. A saree, an unstitched draped cloth, is a distinguishing Indian subcontinent women's dress. The saree is worn with an underskirt known as a petticoat and a short-fitting blouse known by various names throughout India. <br>

The fit and styling of a saree blouse differ from that of a Western blouse. Historians believe that the saree blouse evolved from the choli, a traditional woman's upper garment worn with a long-flared skirt known as the ghagra or coupled with a saree. A typical traditional choli is a body-fitting garment that supports the bust and is tied at the back with strings, whereas the much later saree blouse has a front fastening with hooks and eyes and a covered back.<br>

Nowadays, the blouse is receiving a lot of attention; gone are the days when the only ornamental feature on a shirt seemed to be a drawstring tie at the back. Today, the possibilities are limitless.
